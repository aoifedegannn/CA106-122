* make sure you lay your files out the same way I have so that the layout is tidy
* check with other members before deciding on your colour scheme so that they are all coherent
* so the only links that work right now are obviously my ones because the your pages don’t exist yet so that’s grand
* my idea is that as you can see the home page and my gymnastics page pretty much are the same layout except my page has the extra navigation bar for my own sub home pages
* i think it makes sense for us all to have the same things in our individual nav bars so i have examples on my page we can leave it at that or change if we want
* the colours are different but you can see that it’s the same layout (title and writing in black, borders in the boldest of the colour, background is a pastel of the colour etc) so i was thinking we all follow this structure so for example let Gaa be green, Combat Sports be purple, Boxing be blue and Water polo be Yellow/Orange. I think this is a nice way to see that each page was made by someone else without making them totally different because realistically on a website all the pages are literally the exact same colours/layout/structure so i think this is a nice way of displaying that it’s multiple creators
* and also as you can see the contact form page is the same colour scheme as the home page, i did this because none of us “own” these pages so thought it was nice to keep them neutral
* and also when add your content can everyone talk about women in sport too so the page is inclusive
* we can change the title and stuff haha i couldn’t think of anything else, if you guys have anything you’d like me to ad in the little home page description box just let me know :)
* read shared google doc if consued and feel free to add to it
